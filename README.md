# Scandinavian keyboard layout

A lot of scandinavian developers flock to the ever popular english keyboard layout due to the convenience of the layout. Essentials, like the curly brackets, are simply placed in such a way that the scandinavian developer must perform hand yoga in order to create these symbols. This is of course given that they want acces to their favorite scandinavian letters like Æ, Ø or Å at the same time. You can absolutely get the best of both worlds, and with this keyboard layout, you can type Ø to your hearts content, and write brackets of any sort whilst your hand still remaining ergonomic.
